Please see attached for the data cleaning exercise. It should not take more than an hour to complete, but you will have one week to complete it. 

 

Please see the attached dataset.

- This data and the questions herein are confidential.
- This exercise does not require more than an hour, although you are welcome to spend as much time on it as you like.
- The aim of this exercise is to test a data source which claims to be predictive of future returns of the SP500 index (use SPY as a proxy).
- The “signal” in the table is received at the end of the day (that is to say, contemporaneous with the SPY price shown in the table). We do not have a prior conviction about the forecast horizon over which the signal is effective.
- The first step in this endeavor is data cleaning. Identify any errors in the data, flag them with a note, and suggest a corrected value or if advisable, you may choose to ignore them for purposes of your analysis.
 

Requested Output: Present an analysis of the predictive power of this signal, with your conclusions about its viability and shortcomings, and your brief recommendation to a Portfolio Manager. This may take the form of a brief note with any relevant graphs.

 

NOTE: Please do not seek advice or help from other individuals. This should be your own work product.
